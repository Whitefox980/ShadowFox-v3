[# ShadowFox v3 ü¶ä‚öîÔ∏è

Welcome to the third evolution of the ShadowFox system.

This version is not just an upgrade ‚Äî it's a complete tactical redefinition.  
While the public sees traces of our past work, ShadowFox v3 moves autonomously, adapts intelligently, and strikes silently.  
Its modules are AI-coordinated, mutation-aware, and fine-tuned for recon, fuzzing, and bypass.

## Core Concepts
- Mission-based orchestrator
- Adaptive fuzzing logic
- AI-assisted tactical decision-making
- Real-time proof collection
- Stealth-ready payload traffic shaping

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclosure
This is **not** a final product.
This is **not** for script kiddies.
This is **not** your typical "ethical" tool.

You‚Äôve been warned.

_The fox has evolved._
